# Time Series Forecasting of AAPL Stock Prices

## Dataset(s) Description
This project utilizes a dataset consisting of historical stock prices for Apple Inc. (AAPL), covering several years of trading. The dataset includes the following fields:

- `Date`: The trading day (typically Monday to Friday, excluding holidays).
- `Open`: The price at which the stock started trading during the business day.
- `High`: The highest price of the stock on that trading day.
- `Low`: The lowest price of the stock on that trading day.
- `Close`: The price at which the stock ended trading during the business day.
- `Adj Close`: The stock's closing price after adjustments for all applicable splits and dividend distributions.
- `Volume`: The number of shares that changed hands during the trading day.

The data was sourced from financial markets data providers and is commonly used for quantitative analysis, trading strategy development, and financial modeling. Predicting future stock prices can be crucial for investment decisions and risk management.

## Objectives
The goal is to predict the future closing prices (`Close`) of AAPL stock. Accurate predictions could be valuable for algorithmic trading, portfolio optimization, and risk assessment in production environments.

## Process Overview
The project involved an iterative approach with the following steps:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and relationships.
- Feature Engineering to create additional predictors and transform variables.
- Model Fitting, using ARIMA due to its relevance for time series forecasting.
- Model Evaluation using out-of-sample testing and error metrics like MSE.
- Diagnostic Checks to assess the adequacy of the model.

## EDA
- **X Variables**: Past stock prices (`Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Adj Close`, `Volume`).
- **Y Variable**: Future stock price (`Close`).
- **Type of Problem**: Regression.
- **Observations**: 252 days of trading data.
- **Feature Distribution**: Examined to ensure no significant skewness that might affect the model's performance.
- **Correlation**: Analyzed to avoid multicollinearity issues.

## Feature Engineering
Discussed the necessity of transforming variables and creating new features to improve model performance. Encoding techniques and interaction features were considered.

## Model Fitting
- **Train/Test Split**: An 80/20 split was used, ensuring no leakage of information from the test set into the training process.
- **Model Choice**: The ARIMA model was chosen for its ability to handle time series data and provide interpretable parameters.

## Validation / Metrics
- **Primary Metric**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) was chosen due to its relevance for continuous outcomes.
- **Model Weaknesses**: The limitations of ARIMA, including the assumption of linearity and the difficulty in capturing complex patterns, were acknowledged.

## Production Advice
Recommendations for deploying the model in a production setting are provided, with precautions to avoid overfitting and to ensure continuous monitoring for performance decay.

## Going Further
Suggestions to enhance the model include incorporating more granular data, considering additional external factors, and employing more complex models such as machine learning algorithms.
